        Hello! My name is Jonathan. I graduated from Oregon State University
        in 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Security.

        Initially, I attended Oregon State to study Mechanical Engineering.
        Learning MATLAB during my Sophomore year made me realize I would enjoy studying
        anything computer and software related. More specifically, security related topics
        such as networking and malware analysis, but also web design.

        My hobbies include graphic design / design, video games, and photography.
